Although a bash file exists, as you may wish to supply your own path to your own bagfile, I suggest copying the bash file into your
terminal with the following addition where <bag_path> is the path to your bagfile. Bagfiles should contain:
/camera/depth/image_raw
/camera/rgb/image_raw

at the minimum.

$rosparam set /use_sim_time true
$roslaunch seg_depth openni_sim.launch bag_paht:=<bag_path>

Alternatively you can change the default bag path in the launch file and just run the bash file.

source openni_sim.bash

This will set the time params and then call openni_sim.launch, a launch file to launch openni without the drivers,
to launch the bag file in ../bagfiles/raw.bag and the node seg_color, to demonstrate segmentation.
